Assignment No.5

Q1. What is Statically Typed and Dynamically Typed Programming Language ?
Ans: Statically Typed are the programming languages in which the memory of the variable is given during the compilation time itself. For e.g. C, C++, Java, etc. 
            Like... int age = 23;        //here "int" data-type (memory space) is given already before complilation 
        Dynamically Typed are the programming languages in which the memory of the variable is given during the execution time itself. For e.g. Python, PHP, JavaScript etc. 
            Like... age = 23;        //here no any memory space is given before execution 


Q2. What is the variable in Java ?
Ans:  A Variable is referred to as the name of a memory location. It works like a container that holds a value while the Java Program is executed.
         E.g. int age = 33;    // Here '33' is stored in the variable named 'age' 


Q3. How to assign a value to a variable ?
Ans: Type 1: We can declare & assign a variable directly..
                    E.g. int marks = 68; 
        Type 2: Variables can be declared & assigned separately..
                    E.g. int marks;
                           marks = 68;
             (Note: data-type can be assigned only once)


Q4. What are Primitive Data Types in Java ?
Ans: The Primitive Data Types in Java include Boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double. 
        This data-type is used to store number, character & logical data. Each data type has its own capacity and features to store data.

Q5. What are the Identifiers in Java ?
Ans: An Identifier is just the name given to a variable, method, class, package or interface.
        In a particular program, all the identifiers must have different names. 


Q6. List the operators in Java.
Ans: There are 6 types of operators in Java...
        1. Arithmetic Operators
        2. Relational Operators
        3. Logical Operators
        4. Assigment Operators
        5. Unary Operators
        6. Bitwise Operators


Q7. Explain about Increment & Decrement Operators & give an example.
Ans:  Increment Operators: 
                 E.g. int a = 8;
                            a = a+1;    
                            System.out.Println (a);   //Result 6
                 But this "a=a+1" can be written as "a++". This process is called "Incrementation" & "a++" is called Increment Operator.
                 Syntax: VarName++

                There are two types of Increment Operator =>
                1) Post Increment => VarName++  (the value of variable increases by 1 but stored only in memory for next process)
                2) Pre Increment => ++VarName   (the value of variable increases by 1)


               Decrement Operators: 
                 E.g. int a = 8;
                            a = a-1;    
                            System.out.Println (a);   //Result 7
                 But this "a=a-1" can be written as "a--". This process is called "Decrementation" & "a--" is called Decrement Operator.
                 Syntax: VarName--

                There are two types of Increment Operator =>
                1) Post Decrement => VarName--  (the value of variable decreases by 1 but stored only in memory for next process)
                2) Pre Decrement => --VarName   (the value of variable decreases by 1)
